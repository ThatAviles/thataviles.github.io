					You probably guess - and guessed correctly - that I'm David Aviles. Before I get onto who I really am, and what I do, I think It's important to explain where I'm from. This is usually the moment many of my friends will start sighing and saying "Here he goes again" (Yes I mean you, Adam). I was born in Phoenix, Arizona, on May 22nd in the year 2000. Shortly after my birth, my family
					moved to Colorado. You know, the American state that's famous for legal weed. But back then it wasn't like that. Anyway, I lived in Colorado for six years
					before moving to Mexico. A country famous for it's tacos (Delicious god-damn tacos). We lived on the coast, in a place called "Ensenada", in "Baja California
					 Norte". Don't get me started on how that literally means "Lower Northern California". Although I was having fun as toddler, my mother was worried about the whole "Drug dealer down the street next to the taco shop" thing, so she figured the family should move to Israel after being in Mexico for two years. Hey, we're Jewish so why not. En route to Israel, we take a long pit
					 stop in Ireland (A 3-4 month pitstop). We visited family, attended a Bat-Mitzvah. All the good stuff. We finally found a place in Israel to live, a place I called home for the next five years.
					 <em> Ra'anana</em>. I spent a good portion of my life there, and made quite a few great friends while I was at it. If I had a chance to go back and re-live it, I certainly would.
					 But like I said, all good things have to end, and it did. 	<br> <br>
					 My mother got married again, and we moved down south to the land of racism, kangaroos, and beer. <strong> Australia. </strong> I live here now, in Rosebay. It's been two years (almost three) so far and looks like I'll be here for a while.
